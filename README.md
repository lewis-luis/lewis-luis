- 👋 Hi, I’m @lewis-luis aka Lewis L.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Git and Github and try to help others in projects that I think I can help. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing really.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the ArcCW Localization project, since I speak Brazillian Portuguese, heck, that project was the reason that I created a Github account
- 📫 How to reach me, Discord: Lewis L.#8481
